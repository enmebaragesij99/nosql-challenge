# NoSQL-challenge


This is my Module 12- Data NoSQL Databases challenge, which consists of two python notebook files: Part 1- Database and Jupyter Notebook Setup, 
Part 2-Update the Database (both in 1 jupyter notebook file-NoSQL_setup_final) and Part 3-Exploratory Analysis

## Contents

- NoSQL_setup_final(jupyter notebook file)

- NoSQL_analysis_final(jupyter notbook file)

- establishments(JSON file)

## About

-Part 1: Data was imported from the establishments.JSON file and a Database was created('uk_food') with the collection 'establishments'.

-Part2: Modifications to the database and changes to the establishments collection were made, which consisted of: the addition and update of a new restaurant, 
the removal of specific establishments and finally, the conversion of certain string values to numbers.

-Part 3: Analysis of establishments from specific questions which will loacte establishments to visit and avoid, using query, sort, limit, aggregate and creating pipelines
and finally converting that data into DataFrames.


Note; I did receive assistance from a LA in converting the 'RatingValue' strings into Integers and also did confirm in Part 3: Exploratory Analysis Question 2 that the 
number of count documents result is 33 rather than the 34 stated in the rubric.
